In Bangladesh, the Goethe-Institut in Dhaka conducts the exam only once every few months, with only 60-70 seats available. However, each time, more than 400 students prepare for the exam, but due to the limited seats, many cannot take it at the right time.

Over the past four years, around 80% of those Bangladeshi students who are learning German have traveled to Kolkata for the exam, as Kolkata Goethe-Institut conducts exams three times a month with a higher number of seats available. I have been trying to get a seat in Dhaka since last October but have not succeeded. Therefore, I want to take the exam at the Goethe-Institut in Kolkata.`;

In Bangladesh, the Goethe-Institut Dhaka holds exams only a few times a year with 60-70 seats, while over 500 students prepare each time. Due to limited seats, many cannot take the exam on time.

In the past four years, about 80% of Bangladeshi German learners have traveled to Kolkata, as the Goethe-Institut there holds exams thrice a month with more seats. I have been trying for a seat in Dhaka since last October but failed, so I want to take the exam in Kolkata.

Goethe Kolkata – My exam is on February 28, 2025. I have the money receipt and confirmation letter from registration. They send the invitation letter only seven days before the exam. The contact number, +91 33 2264 6602, is in my confirmation letter.
In the past two months, I paid the exam fee twice but couldn’t attend due to the unavailability of a visa file submission slot. If I get a slot this time, please consider my situation.`;
